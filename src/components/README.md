# Components

This folder is for keeping all the reusable (global?) components that are expected to be used througout the app in any place where they are applicable.

The components listed here should (ideally) not tie to any feature exclusively and do not interact with the redux store. Most of the time, we can achieve this goal without spending much effort by focusing on writing simple presentational components.
