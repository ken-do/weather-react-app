# Store

Redux store configuration code. This store uses [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), a set of utilities used to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.

[Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) are the chosen solution for handling side-effects when working with the redux-store. The decision was attributed to the library's readble, synchronous-like syntax and its powerful failures handling and cancelling mechanism.
