# Layouts

Layouts that can be used to wrap views. Some layouts are simple and others render additional components such as the NavBar at the top, they are registed along with views in the `routes.ts` file. This way, switching layout can be achieved conveniently by updating a layout property in the routes config file rather than having to update JSX.
